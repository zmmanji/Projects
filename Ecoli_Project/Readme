Project Guidlines for Ecoli Project developed using Python.

DNA sequences are made up of the four letters A, C, T and G (each letter corresponding to a particular nucleic acid). 
It turns out that, in the genomes of many organisms (including humans), the DNA letters are not distributed randomly, but rather have some regions with more A's and T's and some regions with more C's and G's. It turns out that C/G rich regions tend to have more genes, whereas A/T rich regions tend have more non-functional DNA. 


Functions Implemented to Solve problem:

Implemented the Viterbi Algorithm in Python to analyze the genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is commonly found in the human gut.
