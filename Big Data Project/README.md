Big Data Project on Anomalies in Power Grid Datasets.


Project Task Guildines

- Detecting Anomalies on a power grid dataset
- Organize the data into seasons
- Analyse the data using the different variable provided in the dataset
- Building Hidden Markov Models to detect Contextual Anomalies using Log Liklihood.
- Building Min and Max functions to detect Point Anomalies 
- Designing the Moving Average function to detect Point Anomalies in the Dataset



Please refer to the project report to have an overview of the project guidlines and statistical findings.

Steps to run the program:-

- Main Source Code is data.R
- Make sure to put the Train Data set and Summer Data Set in the same folder as data.R when running.
